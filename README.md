Pretty basic stuff but I will still put the instructions coz i know u dont know these shi-
But first a little rap that i totally totally wrote:-
  
  Yo, it’s Hans’ birthday, let’s go loud,
  Celebrate the king, make him proud!
  Candles lit, yeah, we bring the heat,
  Shout it out, move, get up on your feet!

  So here’s the deal, let’s keep it tight,
  Party hard, Hans, we’ll own the night!
  This birthday jam, it’s your time to shine,
  Happy birthday, Hans, we’re feelin' fine!

Boom mic drop, spitting flames, house on FIREEEEEEEEEE

Now for the steps
Just git clone it, its thats simple my guy.
